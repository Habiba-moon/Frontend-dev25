    <p>Hello world my name is Habiba</p>
    <p>Today 8th of March at Tecnovice, the first thing we did During the morning was a reflection 
        of what was taught yesterday the 7th talking about Git technologies, version controls and how
        they both work hand-in-gloves together.
        Later on we were taught how repositories are created 
        and later on we then we created a repository which was my first and 
        then named it "Frontend Dev25" which we all taught how to clone it on our Desktop for easy modifies access</p>
